# Portfolio-10

This portfolio runs shiny apps in the markdown file. Shiny apps can only run in markdown files if the output is an html file. Because html files cannot be run in github, you will have to download and run the .rmd file locally. I apologize of this. Unfortunately github can't support built in shiny apps for markdown files in r.
